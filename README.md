# Movie-Ticket-Reservation-System-MTRS

# Project Title
Movie Ticket Reservation System

# Description
This program is built using C++ Programming Language and Few Concepts of Object Oriented Programming

# Installation
1. After Downloading The Files, gather it into a folder (folder's name could be of your choice)
2. Keep the name of the file as it is, because it is programmed with such attribute, or else if you can edit the code, you are good to go
3. You'll be needing any Integrated Development Environment IDE (i used VS Code)
4. You'll be needing any Compiler (i used g++)

# Usage
Compile the mtrs.cpp file and execute it
--> Command I Used : Compilation -> g++ mtrs.cpp
--> Command I Used : Execution -> ./a.exe

# Features
1. It involves a very handy use of File Handling and File Manipulation
2. This programs only executes successfully if the Text File based Database is well established, means the Unique Id and Aadhar Number of the user should be in a specific proportion as coded in the program

# Contributing
You can contribute to my code in following ways : -
1. Since a movie ticket can only be booked 7 days prior, there is a function called "void getDate()" which validates the date entered by the user, although it has been passed through 2800+ test cases, still there is a possibility of any error.
2. If seat number 08 and 09 is booked, and if the user pressed 8 or 9, the program won't allow to go further and will ask to enter vacant seat numbers, but if the user entered 08 or 09 the program will move further, this is because 08 and 09 is an "invalid octal digit".
3. I wish to include a "Log Out" functionality, which resets all the current user information, for which i need that program should go to the option panel after every successful or unseccuesssful module usage, so that user get a chance to Log Out Their Account and the program again ask the Unique Id of the new user.
